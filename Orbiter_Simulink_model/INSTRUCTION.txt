In order to visualize the vehicle attitude in FlightGear make the following steps:

1. Put the folder <shuttle> into directory with aircraft model.Default directory is: C:\Program Files\FlightGear\data\Aircraft
2. launch the runfg.bat file, it will open the FlightGear with support of external dynamics mode.


In order to run the simulation model in Simulink follow the instruction below:

1. Open the Orbite_InitialParamaters.m file in Matlab and RUN it; it will put all necessary variables into workspace.The Shuttle_Orbiter_FDM.slx will be opend in Simulink; 
2. RUN the simulation in Simulink.

By the default the control system is activated and landing is in automatic in longitudinal axes.
Switch to manual mode to control vehicle by keyboard and mouse.


Notes:
The simulation model built in Matlab ver. R2013b. and desing for connection with FlightGear ver. 2.10 or later.
Additionally used Aerosim Blockset for Simulink.
